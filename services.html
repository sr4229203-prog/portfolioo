        <p>Custom-built solutions tailored to your business needs. From concept to deployment, I handle every aspect of development.</p>

        <h2>Mobile App Development</h2>
        <div class="project-meta">iOS, Android, and Cross-platform apps</div>
        
        <h3>What I Do:</h3>
        <p>I build mobile apps from scratch. Whether you need an iOS app, Android app, or both, I can handle it. I can also use Flutter or React Native if you want to launch on both platforms at once.</p>
        
        <h3>The Process:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Design first</strong> – I work with you to design the app so it actually feels good to use</li>
          <li><strong>Build it right</strong> – Clean code using Swift, Kotlin, Flutter, or React Native</li>
          <li><strong>Connect it</strong> – Links to your backend with APIs and databases</li>
          <li><strong>Make it work offline</strong> – Your app saves data locally so it works even without internet</li>
          <li><strong>Make it fast</strong> – Optimized for battery life, storage, and smooth performance</li>
          <li><strong>Test thoroughly</strong> – I test everything before you launch</li>
          <li><strong>Get it on stores</strong> – Handle App Store and Google Play submissions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>What You Get:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Full app ready to launch</li>
          <li>Clean, documented code</li>
          <li>Ready for Apple App Store and Google Play</li>
          <li>Documentation on how to use the app</li>
          <li>30 days of support after launch</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>How Long Does It Take?</h3>
        <p><strong>Simple app:</strong> 4-8 weeks | <strong>Medium app:</strong> 8-16 weeks | <strong>Complex app:</strong> depends, let's talk</p>

        <h2>Backend & API Development</h2>
        <div class="project-meta">Node.js, Python, Firebase, REST APIs</div>
        
        <h3>What I Do:</h3>
        <p>I build the engine behind your app. The backend is what makes everything work – it stores your data, handles requests, and keeps everything secure and fast.</p>
        
        <h3>The Work:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Build your APIs</strong> – Clean APIs that your app talks to, with real-time updates when needed</li>
          <li><strong>Set up databases</strong> – Organized databases that grow with your business, with backups automatically</li>
          <li><strong>Make it secure</strong> – Password protection, encryption, and security checks so user data is safe</li>
          <li><strong>Deploy it</strong> – Get it running on cloud servers (AWS, Firebase, etc) so it's always available</li>
          <li><strong>Make it scalable</strong> – Built to handle more users later without falling apart</li>
          <li><strong>Test everything</strong> – Make sure everything works and catches errors automatically</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>What You Get:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A working backend system</li>
          <li>Documentation explaining how to use it</li>
          <li>Database setup and ready to go</li>
          <li>Security review and tips</li>
          <li>Instructions to deploy and run it</li>

        <h2>Aviation & Maintenance Systems</h2>
        <div class="project-meta">Aircraft Maintenance, Aerospace, Compliance Ready</div>
        
        <h3>What I Do:</h3>
        <p>I build systems for maintenance teams in aviation. These are apps and tools that help mechanics, inspectors, and engineers do their jobs better – with less paperwork and zero room for error.</p>

          <li><strong>Reports and compliance</strong> – Auto-generate reports for audits. Everything logged with timestamps</li>
